### Added

old API User start meeting logic:
```
NSDictionary * paramDict = @{kMeetingParam_UserID:kSDKUserID,
                          kMeetingParam_UserToken:kSDKUserToken,
                          kMeetingParam_UserType:@(userType),
                          kMeetingParam_Username:kSDKUserName,
                          kMeetingParam_MeetingNumber:kSDKMeetNumber,
                          kMeetingParam_IsAppShare:@(appShare),
                          //kMeetingParam_ParticipantID:kParticipantID,
                          kMeetingParam_NoAudio:@(YES),
                          //kMeetingParam_NoVideo:@(YES),
                          };
MobileRTCMeetingService *ms = [[MobileRTC sharedRTC] getMeetingService];
MobileRTCMeetError ret = [ms startMeetingWithDictionary:paramDict];
```

new API User start meeting logic:
```
MobileRTCMeetingStartParam * param = nil;

MobileRTCMeetingStartParam4WithoutLoginUser * user = [[[MobileRTCMeetingStartParam4WithoutLoginUser alloc]init] autorelease];
        user.userType = MobileRTCUserType_APIUser;
        user.meetingNumber = kSDKMeetNumber;
        user.userName = kSDKUserName;
        user.userToken = kSDKUserToken;
        user.userID = kSDKUserID;
        user.zak = kZAK;
        user.isAppShare = appShare;
        param = user;

Interface [[[MobileRTC sharedRTC] getAuthService] getUserType] would not return the correct Usertype.
